Personal instanced plots where players can build, decorate, and display achievements. Creates long-term investment and a gold sink.

### 2. Pet / Companion System
Collectible creatures that follow you, provide minor buffs, or help with gathering. Could tie into monster drops or breeding mechanics.

### 3. Guild / Clan System
Shared guild banks, group quests, territory control, guild leveling with unlockable perks. Social glue that keeps players returning.

### 4. Seasonal Events & Limited-Time Content
Holiday events with exclusive cosmetics, temporary bosses, or mini-games. Creates FOMO and regular return points.

Track milestones (first 1000 kills, max a skill, rare drops) with visible titles and cosmetic rewards.

### 6. Player-to-Player Trading / Auction House
Direct trades and/or a marketplace where players can list items. Drives economy and social interaction.

### 7. Dungeon Instances / Boss Raids
Group content with unique mechanics, exclusive loot tables, and weekly lockouts. Gives endgame players goals.

Rotating objectives with bonus rewards. Simple but effective for daily logins.

### 10. Bounty Board / Dynamic World Events
Server-wide events like boss spawns, invasions, or treasure hunts that require community coordination.
